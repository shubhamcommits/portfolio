                I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and businesses. My journey has been 
                about more than just writing code ‚Äì it&apos;s about building systems that scale, leading teams 
                that innovate, and creating solutions that make a real difference. From managing infrastructure 
                for millions of users to mentoring the next generation of engineers, every experience has 
                shaped my approach to problem-solving and leadership.
